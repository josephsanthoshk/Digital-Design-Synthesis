Step 1: Verify System Dependencies

Before starting, ensure that the following are installed and accessible within your system's PATH environment variable:

wish: The Tcl/Tk GUI interpreter.
ModelSim: The simulator, specifically ensuring the vsim command is available.
Python: Along with necessary plotting libraries such as matplotlib.

Step 2: Initiate the Graphical User Interface (GUI)

Open a command prompt or terminal window.
Navigate to the directory containing the sine_wave_gui_flow.tcl script.
Execute the script using the command: wish sine_wave_gui_flow.tcl

Step 3: Interact with the GUI and Trigger Simulation

A GUI window will appear. Enter an integer value between 0 and 1023 (inclusive) into the designated input field. This value represents the frequency.
Click the "Run Simulation" button.
Automated Actions Following Simulation Trigger:

The input frequency value will be automatically saved to a file named frequency.txt.
ModelSim will be launched in batch mode to execute the simulation based on the provided frequency.
Upon successful simulation, a plot of the generated waveform will be displayed.
